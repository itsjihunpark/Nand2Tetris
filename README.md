In this project, I am building a simple instruction set, 16bit, Von Neumann variant hardware platform from elemental logic gate (Nand) defined with Hardware Definition Language (HDL). This project based learning is credited entirely to the book:  [The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles (The MIT Press): Nisan, Noam, Schocken, Shimon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686)

| Boolean Arithmetic | > 5 hours  | Hardware | started | Implement combinational chips by writing HDL for (given basic chips) and test them using compare files: <br> *Adders* <br> - [ ] **Half-adder** <br> - [ ] **Full-adder** <br> - [ ] **Adder**<br> - [ ] **Incrementer**<br><br> *Arithmetic Logic Unit* <br> - [ ] **Arithmetic Logic Unit** 
| Memory | > 5 hours  | Hardware | started | Implement sequential chips by writing HDL for (given basic data flip flop) and test them using compare files: <br> *Memory chips* <br> - [ ] **single-bit register** (i.e., bit) <br> - [ ] **16-bit register** (i.e., register) <br> - [ ] **Random Access Memory** (16K/16384 16-bit registers) 
| Machine Language   | > 5 hours  | Hardware | not started |Write two assembly (symbolic machine language) program: <br>- [ ] **Mult.asm** (In: values stored in R0 and R1 aka RAM[0] and RAM[1] aka virtual registers; Computes: R0*R1 and stores results in R2; Assumes R0>=0, R1>=0, and R2<32768) <br> - [ ] **Fill.asm** (I/O handling - An infinite loop that listens to keyboard,  memory mapped in data memory, and when any key is pressed, the program blackens the screen, also memory mapped - in 8K memory block; 256 rows of 512 pixel per row - in data memory starting at RAM[16384])   
| Computer Architecture | > 5 hours  | Hardware | not started | Implement following chips by writing HDL for (given all previously implemented chips) and test them using compare files: <br> - [ ] **Central Processing Unit** <br> - [ ] **ROM 32K** (i.e., instruction memory) <br> - [ ] **Screen chip** (i.e., interfaces with a physical screen -  256 rows of 512 b/w pixels each - via a memory map implemented by a  16-bit, 8K RAM chip) <br> - [ ] **Keyboard chip** (i.e., interfaces with physical keyboard via a memory map implemented by keyboard chip - read only 16 bit register with a side effect of reflecting the state of the physical keyboard) <br> - [ ] **Data memory** (i.e., realises the data memory with a set of three 16-bit chip-parts: RAM16K, Screen, and Keyboard) <br> - [ ] **Computer chip** (i.e., Topmost element; a computer-on-a-chip named Computer that can be connected to a screen, and keyboard). When 'reset' input is set to 1 and then to 0, the computer should start executing the currently loaded program after which, the fate of the computer user is "at the mercy of the software")
| Assembler | > 5 hours  | Hardware meets Software | not started | Develop an assembler, using any high-level programming language, that translates programs written in assembly language (symbolic machine language) into binary code (binary machine language) and test them using compare files: <br> - [ ] **Parser** <br> - [ ] **Code module**

| Virtual Machine II: Control| > 5 hours  | Software | not started | 
| High level language | > 5 hours  | Software | not started | 
| Compiler I: Syntax Analysis | > 5 hours  | Software | not started | 
| Compiler II: Compiler II: Code Generation | > 5 hours  | Hardware | not started |
